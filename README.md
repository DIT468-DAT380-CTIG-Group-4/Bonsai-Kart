# Bonsai Kart

Ever wanted a semi-sentient bonsai tree on wheels? No? Well you got one here anyway! \

your tree, let it get enough sunshine, and play with it. The little bonsai loves to race,
so make sure to let it race!


## Setup

- Download the [`bonsai_kart.apk`](https://github.com/DIT468-DAT380-CTIG-Group-4/Bonsai-Kart/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha/bonsai_kart.apk) file on an Android device (Android 8.0 or later)
- Install the application from the downloaded file
- Run the application

## Gameplay

To race with ypur Bonsai Kart, click on the checkered flag button once to cast the racetrack, another to spawn and it and get access to the controls.
